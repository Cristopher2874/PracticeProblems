## Algorithms in C++

**Introduction**

There are different tipes of languages:
* Machine languages (binary code and bits): 01101
* Assembly languages (mnemonics and symbols): DIV, ADD
* High-level languages (C, C++, Java, Python, etc.): System.out.println("Hello world");

**Definition of algorithm**

* Set of instructions and operations to solve a defined problem or task.
* It is required to perfectly define the operarions and varibles to use.
* The algortihm must be universal, meaning that with the same set of data, must return the same output.
* The time in the algorithm must be finite.

**Structured programming**

A specific program could only be defined by three tipes of structures:
* Secuencial structures
* Repetitive structures
* Selective structures

> Edsger Dijkstra created the concept of modularization and eliminated the block GOTO.

Today, the structures are modularized including modules for the general information to the specific details.

> The language C was created by Dennis Ritchie during the final years of 1960. It was an imperative language with characteristics from B.

**Stages of software development**

* Problem comprenhension
* Algorithmic design
* Code
* Compilation and excecution
* Testing and debugging
* Documentation

**Data types in C**

| Type | Size (32b) | Description |
|------|------------|-------------|
| char | 1         | charcter 1 byte |
| B    | 20         |
| C    | 30         |
