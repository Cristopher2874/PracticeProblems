## How to write best code

**Not perfect, but functional code**

**Well written, avoid not knowking the sintaxis**

Wait until you are ready to code, code when you know the path:

* Readability
* Maintanability
* Correctness
* Performance

Consider this following details:

* Input, Output data types
* Index math
* Helper functions
* Data structure and when they change

**Goal: demonstrate you are a great coder**

* Think about errors, edge cases, bounds and limits for data structures
* Structured code: use modules
* Most interesting line of code
* Pieces of the code that are the core of the algorithm
